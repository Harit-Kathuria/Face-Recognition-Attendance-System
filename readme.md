#Face Detection Attendance System
<br/>
###About: <br/>
This project is a model of Basic Machine Learning. <br/>
It uses face detection system to recognise the faces and mark their attendance accordingly.<br/>
Firstly, we train the system with some faces by storing them in a folder and passing the folder path to the system. After training is done, then it is ready to detect the faces and mark their attendance.<br/>
The attendance is stored in a csv file with the person's name and its date and time of detection. The name is assumed as the name by which the image is stored.<br/>
Here's a view of how the system detects image after it is trained.<br/><br/>
